## 2nd Training
This training is based on a book **Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit Learn and TensorFlow** and for me to be able to understand more effectively I rewrite the code and experimenting with the given code by myself

The hands-on project i have done in this training are :
1. California estate - predicting california price based on the location and other things

2. MNIST - the goal in this training is to enables machines to recognize handwritten digits. 

3. Titanic Survival Project - in this project I'm predicting whether someone would have survived if they were in the titanic ship.

## 1st Training
Learning how KNN algorithms work and try to implement it by predicting Car quality based on the car feature </br>
